# Python  Network Spoofer

This Python script is a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack tool designed to manipulate network traffic by spoofing ARP and IPv6 packets. It utilizes the `scapy`, `colorama`, and `getmac` libraries.




## Features
- Spoof ARP packets to redirect traffic between a target machine and the gateway.
- Spoof IPv6 packets to redirect traffic between a target machine and the gateway (optional).
- Automatically retrieves MAC addresses.
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library (`pip install scapy`)
- Colorama library (`pip install colorama`)
- Getmac library (`pip install getmac`)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-network-spoofer.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd python-network-spoofer
```
3. Run the script with administrative privileges:
```bash
